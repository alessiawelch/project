### Results

A summarized PDF of the results is available in **`results_compiled.pdf`** (download if not immediately visible). For detailed results, including parameters and individual runs, refer to the **`results`** folder. Each file is appropriately labeled and stored in corresponding Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files for clarity and reproducibility. Plots used in the paper are found in the  **`plots`** folder.

### Runs
The **`common.py`** file contains the initialization of the Max, Sum, and Mean aggregators, as well as the newly implemented **MaxSum Aggregator** using `SAGEConv`.
